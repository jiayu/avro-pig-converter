#Avro-pig-converter project

In my recent project, we had this request to dynamically generate pig tuple from a avro object. I think it would be helpful to generalize the library so as to be used by others.

##Folder structure
There are two folders in this project right now. 1 for the main library code and 2 for the test package come a long with the code.
